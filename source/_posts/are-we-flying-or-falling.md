This morning, I went to work by shuttle bus as usual.

<!--more-->



I was still a little sleepy, especially listening to the broadcast on the bus, and soon I fell asleep drowsily.

I had a dream, I was not feeling well, I felt sick. But I cannot find the medicine.

Suddenly, I heard someone said to me: 

> You are sick at all the places, and the medicine is in the central authority.

I woke up, found it was from the broadcast.

It reminds me of the news that I saw several days ago, it said they will change the constitution late this week.

I am  not sure whether it is true or not, but I will strictly abide by it.

Because we are all STRUGGLING FOR A NEW CHINA.

And also because all my words do not make any difference.
