事实上，阿里不仅是拳王，更是一名民权斗士和诗人，其影响力远远超出了体育、种族和国籍的范畴。下面是阿里最为人熟知的6句话，可以看出他的智慧和人生哲学。

1. The man who views the world at 50 the same as he did at 20 has wasted 30 years of his life.

2. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. Rumble, young man, rumble.

3. What I suffered physically was worth what I’ve accomplished in life. A man who is not courageous enough to take risks will never accomplish anything in life.

4. Don’t count the days. Make the days count.

5. I know where I’m going and I know the truth, and I don’t have to be what you want me to be. I’m free to be what I want.

6. When I feel pain, that’s when I start counting, because that’s when it really counts.
